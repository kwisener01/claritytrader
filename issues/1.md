# Design sleek, modern UI for contractor project dashboard

## Description
Create a professional, modern user interface for contractors to manage projects efficiently. The design should be sleek and intuitive, tailored for contractors to:

- View, update, and track project status
- Receive and send auto-updates to clients
- View project timelines, deliverables, and feedback
- Have a dashboard for quick overviews

The UI should be responsive, visually appealing, and easy to navigate for both contractors and clients. Consider accessibility and modern UX best practices.
